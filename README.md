• The Tour & Travels Customer Churn Prediction dataset assists a travel company in 
predicting customer churn. It includes indicators such as age, frequent flyer status, 
annual income class, services opted frequency, social media account 
synchronization, and hotel bookings. 

• The goal is to build predictive models to save company resources. The dataset, 
used for practice and in a hackathon, is freely available. Analysts can perform 
exploratory data analyses to reveal insights for effective churn prediction. The 
binary target variable distinguishes customers who churn (1) from those who don't 
(0), guiding the modeling process.
